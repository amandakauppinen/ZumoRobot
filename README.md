# ZumoRobot
Zumo Robot with C
Group work with: Salla Vesterinen, Amanda Kauppinen and Abhinav Paudyal
13 December 2017

The purpose of this project was to apply our recently acquired knowledge of the C programming language in a way that was both meaningful and productive. Starting with the Non-Sensor (NS) Track objective and proceeding through the actual Race and Sumo tracks, we learned not only how to work together as a team on a coding project, but also the ups and downs of implementing code on a more complex system than the chip we were using previously. 
 
Competing against both our classmates as well as the Finnish Information Technology students, the overall project put various teams against each other in both the Race and the Sumo tracks. It was found that what we thought were minor problems before competing, became much more apparent and caused us to not be able to complete the track in the way we would have preferred. Despite this, we were partially successful in the Sumo track winning the first round. Though it was completely dependent on many different variables, the structure of our Sumo Code proved to be fairly solid. 
 
Overall there are aspects we would change if possible, but the outcomes in both the Race and Sumo objective were satisfactory. The knowledge obtained through this project is indispensable and will continue to aid in further studies.


Included in this Git repository are the main files for both the race and the sumo competitions as well as the used ZumoLibrary .h files
